## Execution

This module is fully parameterized via the [configuration file](../configuration/reference.md#roi-cutting) and does not require manual intervention.
Consequently, it can be executed via a Jupyter Notebook, standalone script, or as a component of the Nextflow pipeline; further details are available in the [Execution Modes](../usage/execution_modes.md) documentation.
